Homework 1

Purpose: This program enables the client to perform various functions 
on a dynamically allocated array of characters.

Acknowledgments: My function contracts are expressed the way
they were on the assignment spec. My ARC tutor Julia also helped me
quite a bit with my conceptual understanding of copy constructors,
so thank you Julia!

I provide 4 files: the header file, the implementation, a testing
file, and this README. The header file defines the class
CharArrayList and its members, the implementation defines those
public member functions declared in the header file, and the 
testing file tests the efficacy of those public functions.

I compile my program with the following command:
clang++ -Wall -Wextra -o CharArrayList CharArrayList.cpp testCharArrayList.cpp

I run it with the following command:
./CharArrayList

Data structure: I used a dynamically allocated array list defined
in a class. One advantage of using an array rather than, say, a linked list
is that you may easily access data by index without having to traverse
the entire list. Having an index to specify elements is very useful in 
adding, replacing, removing elements at a given index without having to begin
at a head pointer (as we would if we used a linked list). Perhaps a
disadvantage would be that recursive functions are more easily implemented in
a linked list, but this did not cause any problems on this assignment.

Testing: I made a testing function for every of my public member functions,
testing both normal cases and cases which may prompt error messages. For 
example, I used both in range and out of range indices in testing my
insertAt() function to ensure it works in both normal and out of range 
conditions.
